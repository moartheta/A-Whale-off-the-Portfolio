**NOTE**

Whenever I use the .plot function in Jupyter Lab I get the following 'Warning':

C:\Users\grego\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\plotting\_matplotlib\core.py:1235: UserWarning: FixedFormatter should only be used together with FixedLocator
  ax.set_xticklabels(xticklabels)

This is a known bug in Panadas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/35684) that the devs are aware of and are fixing.  It still runs fine, but it is annoying to have that warning pop up whenever you try to run .plot.  I could have added a few lines of code to get rid of it but didn't want to clutter up the code for a small aesthetic reason.
